/**
 * The java.io library defines four abstract classes that are the parents of all I/O stream classes defined within the API:
 * InputStream: Abstract class for all input byte streams.
 * OutputStream: Abstract class for all output byte streams.
 * Reader: Abstract class for all input character streams.
 * Writer:Abstract class for all output character streams.
 *
 * Most InputStream classes have a corresponding OutputStream class
 * Most Reader classes have a corresponding Writer class (page 814)
